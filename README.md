Implementing a JIT Compiled Language with Haskell and LLVM
Following the [tutorial](http://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm) by Stephen Diehl

Setup for Mac OS
* install llvm `brew install homebrew/versions/llvm35`
* in order for GHC to find the library, export the path of llvm to `PATH`, mine is `/usr/local/Cellar/llvm35/3.5.1/bin`
